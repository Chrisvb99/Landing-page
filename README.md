# Landing-page
Welcome to my Landing Page

This is the second assignment project I have done as part of my following of The Odin Project Curriculum.
It consists of me finally making use of all my knowledge of css and flexboxes to develop a web page of higher quality and better UX design (to a certain extent). I have developed it by making reference to a sample image of a webpage provided by TOP itself and I needed to bring it to life from scratch using html and css.
My goal will be to then use the sample web page as a template for a more personalised web page where I can add my own photos and talk more about myself or a topic I'm interested in.

Thanks for reading or checking this out
